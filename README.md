I conducted a project using the UCI Heart Disease Dataset, which aimed to analyze and predict the presence of heart disease based on various medical attributes. The dataset provided detailed information on patients' health parameters such as cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and ECG readings. 

Through exploratory data analysis and machine learning techniques, I identified significant patterns and relationships within the data. Employing classification algorithms, including logistic regression and decision trees, I developed predictive models to classify individuals as either having or not having heart disease based on their medical attributes. The project aimed to contribute to better understanding and early detection of heart disease, potentially assisting healthcare professionals in making informed decisions for patient care.
